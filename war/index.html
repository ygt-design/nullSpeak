            The idea of a single peaceful state inspired by the formation of Tunel, did not bring an end to conflicts.
            Instead, it created new tensions and struggles. The protests by the people of China for union with
            neighbouring countries were perceived as a threat by the Chinese government, leading to a brutal attack on
            Mongolia. This sparked a long and devastating war that lasted 80 years, causing widespread suffering and
            turmoil throughout the world. <br><br>
            The Chinese government's use of the peaceful protests as a pretext for war was a tragic outcome of the
            desire for unity and peace. The war had far-reaching effects, leading to loss of life, displacement of
            people, and widespread destruction. The events of this conflict served as a reminder of the complex and
            delicate nature of political and social relationships, and the importance of finding peaceful solutions to
            conflicts. <br><br>
            The devastating war formed new alliances and ultimately ended with the America and Eurasia alliance as
            victors. In their pursuit of control, they made the entire world submit to their rule, imposing a
            totalitarian system on all people. This new society was characterised by complete control and power being
            held in the hands of a small group, with limited individual freedoms and severe consequences for dissent.
            <br><br>
            The toll of the war was enormous, with only half of the global population surviving. The aftermath of the
            war was marked by widespread loss, displacement, and trauma. Despite this, the victors pressed on with their
            vision of a unified world, imposing their rule and system on all people. This new society was a stark
            contrast to the diverse and decentralised world that existed before, and it brought with it new challenges
            and struggles. The events of this war and the aftermath serve as a warning of the dangers of unchecked power
            and the importance of finding peaceful solutions to conflicts. <br><br>
            The year was 2103. <br><br>
