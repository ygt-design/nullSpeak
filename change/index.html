            The world was rocked by multiple natural disasters, causing widespread destruction and suffering. Despite
            historical tensions and conflicts, countries came together in a show of unity and compassion to offer aid
            and support to those affected. Borders were temporarily forgotten as nations, previously seen as enemies,
            worked together to provide resources and assistance. <br><br>
            This unexpected display of cooperation and unity demonstrated the common humanity that exists across borders
            and political divides. In the face of devastating events, people set aside their differences and came
            together to help their fellow human beings. This showed the world that even in the darkest of times, there
            is hope for unity and compassion. <br><br>
            The outpouring of support from countries around the world served as a reminder of the power of collective
            action and the importance of working together to overcome adversity. The events of this natural disaster
            showed that, when faced with a common challenge, people can come together to make a difference and bring
            hope to those in need. <br><br>
            The idea of unity inspired certain groups to form a single nation, leading to protests and revolutions
            worldwide to break down political borders. The first union nation, "Tunel," was formed and included regions
            starting from northwest Bosnia, through Turkey, Azerbaijan, across the Caspian Sea to the northeast of
            Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. <br><br>
            Though some countries perceived the formation of "Tunel" as a threat, some got inspired and formed a single
            state among Scandinavia/ the United States, Greenland and Canada/ Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia/ and
            Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, New Zealand, and New Caledonia. All these got united under RNU (Roofed
            Nations Union). <br><br>
